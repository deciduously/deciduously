### deciduously

I'm Ben.  I sometimes use programming lanagues to make computers do my bidding - much like you!

I blog on DEV sometimes: [DEV](https://dev.to/deciduousy).  I also have a website, but there's not much there: [deciduously.com](https://deciduously.com).  The best way to reach me is `ben@deciduously.com`.

Have a *great* day!
