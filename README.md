### deciduously

I'm Ben.  I sometimes use programming languages to make computers do stuff.  I like Rust and C++ and Ruby and Elixir.

I currently work at [Tangram](https://www.tangram.dev) building tools that make it easy for programmers to train, deploy, and monitor machine learning models.  Check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/tangramdotdev/tangram)!
